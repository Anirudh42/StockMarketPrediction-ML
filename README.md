# StockMarketPrediction-ML
This project seeks to analyse various machine learning algorithms that predict the trend of stock market closing prices based on past historical data. A detailed report of the analysis can be found in the repository.

## The algorithms analysed were as follows:
- Neural Networks
  - Long Short-Term Memory Networks(LSTM)
  - Feed Forward Nerual Networks
- Support Vector Machines(SVM)
- Linear Regression
